{"name":".vimrc","body":"# Avelino's vim Distribution\r\n\r\nThis is a basic distribution of vim plugins and tools intended to be run\r\non top of the latest MacVIM snapshot.\r\n\r\nWe (Carl and Yehuda) both use this distribution for our own use, and\r\nwelcome patches and contributions to help make it an effective way to\r\nget started with vim and then use it productively for years to come.\r\n\r\nAt present, we are still learning to use vim ourselves, so you should\r\nanticipate a period of rapid development while we get a handle on the\r\nbest tools for the job. So far, we have mostly integrated existing\r\nplugins and tools, and we anticipate to continue doing so while also\r\nwriting our own plugins as appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn general, you can expect that the tools we use work well together and\r\nthat we have given careful thought to the experience of using MacVIM\r\nwith the tools in question. If you run into an issue using it, please\r\nreport an issue to the issue tracker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites\r\n\r\nThe distribution is designed to work with Vim >= 7.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n  `curl https://raw.github.com/avelino/.vimrc/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh`\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n0. `for i in ~/.vim ~/.vimrc ~/.gvimrc; do [ -e $i ] && mv $i $i.old;\r\n   done`\r\n1. `git clone git://github.com/avelino/.vimrc.git ~/.vim`\r\n2. `ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Updating to the latest version\r\n\r\nTo update to the latest version of the distribution, just run `git pull`\r\nagain inside your `~/.vim` directory.\r\n","tagline":"Distro vim","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
